# ASH-DJ-Controller


ASH DJ controller is a basic dj controller for arduino mega 2560 , it basicly sends midi signals to the pc to control a dj software like Virtual-DJ 
this flatform apears as generic midi controller in windows device manager (thanks to MOCO-LUFA)

the controller can handle :

* x40 keys with 16 of them that can change its function based on a mode key for each 8 with 5 modes for each groupe and there is a shift    key that can change the keys function in mode 5 (like the shift key for delete cue)
* x32 faders or potentiometer with 4 of them that changes its signals based on the mode switches (2 for each mode switch)
* x2 encoders
* x2 5-way mode switches (it can be used to switch between loops , hot cue , samplers , etc...)
* x2 shift keys (it can be used to delete hot cues )


there will be more featurs in future...
